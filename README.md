## Functionality

* The quiz is composed of seven multiple-choice questions. When the user clicks on the start button, a timer for 100 seconds activates. For each incorrect answer, user's time gets subtracted by five seconds. The game terminates when the user provides answers to all questions or runs out of time. At the end of the game, the user is prompted to enter initials to record the final score, which becomes accessible under the High Score Ranking link. 

## Features

* In an effort to provide the user with a smoother experience, bootstrap flexbox grid and Google Fonts are fully utilized throughout the application.
